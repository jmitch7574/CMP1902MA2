"""
The Gameboard stores all cells
The cells are stored in a 2D array that goes column by column

Row by row is generally better for board games as it makes more visual sense
you start at [0, 0] in the top right, go to the end of the row and start on the next one
until you get to the bottom right corner [height, width]

Due to the nature of connect4 having a large reliance on columns
it'll make it easier to write certain functions (such as discs falling)
especially with removing discs, if the bottom of the column (index 0) is removed
then every disc above it moves down one, e.g index 1 will now be at index 0

The only downside to this is that printing out the board becomes a bit trickier
and the board in general becomes slightly harder to visualise
(worth it in my opinion to avoid spaghetti code everywhere else)
